This is the visualization of the Fortune's algorithm for generating Voronoi diagrams.

The implementation of the Fortune's algorithm was downloaded from http://blog.ivank.net/fortunes-algorithm-and-implementation.html

This project was done as a project for the course of Computational Geometry, Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade, Serbia. The professor of the course is Predrag Janicic (http://poincare.matf.bg.ac.rs/~janicic/), and the assistant Danijela Petrovic (http://poincare.matf.bg.ac.rs/~danijela/).
